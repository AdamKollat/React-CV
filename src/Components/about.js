            <p>Prior to 2020 I had been working in restaurant management all the way up until the beginning of the Covid pandemic. As the world went into lockdown I reevaluated my career options and decided that it was the perfect opportunity for me to take on a new challenge so I committed all my spare time to studying web development. As a self taught developer it took me 18 months to secure my first position in tech and I can honestly say that this has been the best decision of my life. I thoroughly enjoy working as a web developer and I am keen to learn more about popular technologies. I am comfortable working with the core technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) but for a full list of my skills please find attached list below.</p>
