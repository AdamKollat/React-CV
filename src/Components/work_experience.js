            <p class='grey'>09/2021 - Present</p>
            <p>I joined Clevertouch Marketing as a Martech Specialist in late 2021. This position has helped me to turn my theoretical knowledge to practical experience in the field of front end web development. My duties included building HTML emails and Landing pages for our clients (such as Orange Business Services and Fujitsu) along with building and maintaining marketing campaigns using marketing automation platforms. I have also been involved in voluntary development projects within the tech delivery team. One such project required my team to integrate two scheduling platforms using APIs. The aim of the project was to build a process that automatically syncs holiday bookings from our staff holiday planner to our scheduling platform (Adobe Workfront). We successfully delivered the project in 3 months mostly working on it in our spare time.</p>
